Politcal satire:
 - Aristophanes uses political satire to poke fun at the politics of athens. The plot is about the two athenians who are tired of Athens. 
 The fact they come up with an idea of making a big island in the sky, shows how absurd the politcal powers were at the time. Cloudcuckooland
 was used as a metaphor for the politics of Athens.

 - The birds in the play are personified, to be used for comedy, examples are the crazyness of having birds speak and declare war on the
 gods, the birds also to give an outsiders view on human society, having birds interact with the humans can allow Aristophanes to make
 comments on humans way of thinking through the Birds. 

Slapstick:
 - The birds also consisted of physical humor and slapstick. An example is when Pisthetaerus whipped the poet. This form of humour would
 be more apparent when watching the play, Aristophanes wanted the characters to have an exaggerated form of movement and slapstick.

 - The Birds explores many aspects of Athenian society, such as on going legal disputes, the need for power, and the constant change of
 public opinion. using these familiar issues to the athenian public, Aristophanes allows his audience to think about society from a different view.
