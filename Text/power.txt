Aristophanes explores the theme of power within the play "The Birds" to convey his ideas to his audience. This Segment will explore the 
many different characters and ideas that Aristophanes used to express his message about power and how it affects society. Examples include
political power within the play and why Pisthetaerus and Euelpides rejected it. Divine power of how humans are able to challange the gods and
Social power and manipulation mainly the manipulation that Pisthetaerus uses.

In "The Birds" Aristophanes expresses his ideas on power through Pisthetaerus and Euelpides commentary on Athens political power. These two characters
flee Athens in search of a better life, express their own disillusionment with Athens political corruption and stupidity. This not only reflects the
characters opinions but also Aristophanes personal opinions of Athens. Later when Pisthetaerus builds Cloudcuckooland, the struggle to make sure 
that everyone is doing the right thing shows how it is hard to not have a political power in place to keep order and relative peace. Aristophanes
also touches on the theme of divine power and how man can challange the gods. Pisthetaerus does this by creating Cloudcuckooland to starve the gods of 
their sacrifices, allowing Pisthetaerus to bargain with the gods and take their power. Aristophanes uses this to show the audience that diving power is
not invincible and can be overthrown through strategy. Pisthetaerus demonstrates his abillity to control others through speech. His manipulation of the birds
to build Cloudcuckooland and his dealing with the gods show how power can be obtained through persuasion.

Aristophanes uses the plots in the play to create deeper messages about power, the ability to maintain power and how quickly it can be overthrown.
Aristophanes critiques the political and social power during his time, while also exporing broader types of power involving the gods.
