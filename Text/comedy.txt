Aristophanes uses comedy in his play "The Birds" not only to captivate his audience
but to also get them to think about their society from a new viewpoint. This will explain
a few different ways Aristophanes used comedy to engage his audience into the play. Poking
fun at Athenian politics, slapstick humour and quick remarks with deeper meanings
are all ways Aristophanes gives his audience another view on life.

Aristophanes uses political satire to poke fun at the politics of athens. The plot is about the two athenians who are tired of Athens.
The fact they come up with an idea of making a big island in the sky, shows how absurd the politcal powers were at the time.
Cloudcuckooland was used as a metaphor for the politics of Athens. The birds in the play are personified, to be used for comedy,
examples are the crazyness of having birds speak and declare war on the gods, the birds also to give an outsiders view on human society,
having birds interact with the humans can allow Aristophanes to make comments on humans way of thinking through the Birds. The birds also
consisted of physical humour and slapstick. An example is when Pisthetaerus whipped the poet. This form of humour would be more apparent when
watching the play, Aristophanes wanted the characters to have an exaggerated form of movement and slapstick. The Birds explores many aspects of Athenian society,
such as on going legal disputes, the need for power, and the constant change of public opinion. Using these familiar issues to the athenian public,
Aristophanes allows his audience to think about society from a different view.

Aristophanes uses comedy in The Birds not only to entertain, but to create thought provoking questions and reflection among the audience.
By combining the comedy on political satire, absurd situations and the slapstick humor, he makes a play that is able to make people laugh
and question together.
